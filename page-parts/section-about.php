      <h3>Collaboration &amp; Compliance</h3>
      <p>CarePanda is the ONLY secure messaging system designed specifically for the Addiction Treatment Industry by Addiction Treatment Professionals. CarePanda allows everyone involved with a patient’s treatment to collaborate throughout the process in a fully secure and compliant manner to ensure world class care in the fight against addiction.</p>
      <h4><strong>Collaboration</strong></h4>
      <p>Add &amp; Remove participants “on the fly” to ensure critical care providers are aware of potential dangers during treatment without inundating busy professionals with unnecessary “chatter”.  Timely communication helps with VOBs (Verification of Benefits), avoids costly AMAs (Patient Discharge Against Medical Advice) and provides faster receipt of lab reports.</p>
      <h4><strong>Compliance</strong></h4>
      <p>Addicts, who might otherwise avoid seeking treatment for fear of negative retribution, can take comfort in the knowledge that their electronic Patient Health Information (ePHI) is protected by the strongest encryption measures in the industry. Be prepared for CARF and Joint Commission accreditation and meet new compliance regulations from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>
